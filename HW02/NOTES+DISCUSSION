NOTES

- use run-all.sh to run all programs and see their results
- i use custom StopWatch because the provided version was not compatible. it uses same interface as the provided StopWatch.

DISCUSSION

- the data for this homework can be stored in many different ways and optimal data layout may have big impact on performance
- i designed experiments to compare different configurations:

100 runs each with N = 10, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000

I compared time since initialization of array with spheres until the colissions were fully detected

My configuration:
Ubuntu 11.10 running on VirtualBox
Intel Core i3 CPU 3.2 GHz
1.5GB memory

The configurations I tested:
1.XYZ,R with simulated array + row major - good data layout but very similar performance to say it's best
2.XYZR with simulated array + row major - good data layout but very similar performance to say it's best
3.X,Y,Z,R with simulated array + row major - very similar performance
4.XYZ,R with look-alike array + row major
5.XYZ,R with simulated array + column major - didn't perform well because row data were fetched into cache but not used
6.XYZ,R with look-alike array + column major - didn't perform well because row data were fetched into cache but not used
